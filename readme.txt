Simple Update is the perfect plugin for any WordPress user that needs an easier way to update content on a post or page without having to search through the text and HTML.

With this plugin you can easily create shortcuts for headers, sub-headers, paragraphs, quotes, stats, and more. 

The Simple Update plugin is perfect for:
